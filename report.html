	<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
    <p>The CMP1130M Web Authoring assessment allowed understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of current web specifications and standards over previous versions ensuring maximum interoperability. Furthermore, to ensure that our websites meet current web standards and specifications, we had a peer review session.  This allowed us to present our website design for improvement and expanding our feature list.  Our websites could include hyperlinks, text effects and graphical styles, multimedia and local web storage.</p>

	<p><u>Web Standards and Specifications</u></p>
    <p> “They’re a set of rules that web designers follow... They are guidelines for clarity and usability.”  (Orbit Media). These rules allow web designers, to create a website that all users will be able to use and navigate.  Each key feature, such as logo, navigation and social media icons, are all situated in the same places in different websites that allow for ease of use. Past standard and specification were not followed as closely therefore websites tended to look differently.  This ensued chaos for users as they had to figure out where features were within the website.</p>
	<p>Current web standards include and what I included:</p>
	<p>...Logo/brand name in the top left...</p>
	<center><img src="Assets/logname.png" alt="logname"></center>
	<p>The English language governs us to read left to right therefore the brand name is view first immediately showing what company website they are viewing. </p>
	
	<p>...Main navigation across the top...</p>
	<center><img src="Assets/lognav.png" alt="lognav"></center>
	<p>The navigation at the top, allows for ease of use at the navigation is clearly seen and the position will not change.  </p>
	
	<p>...Home page slideshow...</p>
	<center><img src="Assets/logslide.png" alt="logslide"></center>
	<p>A slideshow on the homepage gives the user a small look into the brand and is a professional and effective way of showing off the brand.</p>
		
	<p>...Social media icons in the footer...</p>
	<center><img src="Assets/logsocial.png" alt="logsocial"></center>
	<p>The social media icons in the footer allows for ease of use as the icons are clearly seen and the position will not change.</p>
	
	<p>...Responsive design...</p>
	<center><img src="Assets/logresponsive.png" alt="logresponsive"></center>
	<p>Responsive navigation allows it be used in different browsers and different devices such as mobile. </p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Additionally, there other standards such as the brand standards, for example I choose Coca-Cola therefore I had specific colours such as red, white and black to show the brand.  Also, there are coding standards governed by the W3C, this allows for a continuity of elements working within the website and browser.  Furthermore, there are accessibility standards which make the website accessible to everyone.</p>
	<p>A strength of using a set of web standards and specifications is that there is overall reduced cost due to responsive design for mobile, for different web browsers, for consoles, etc.  As dedicated companies are not needed to alter the website for the different platforms thus diminishing the cost of the website.  Another strength is that the website is more compact as there is less code within the webpage.  Therefore, search engines have less to compile so relevant information can be extracted efficiently.  Furthermore, another strength is “Forward compatibility” (Romjon), if every website is working on the same web standards and specifications then there is an increasing pressure to carry this forward, thereby making all websites more reliable.  </p>
    <p>A weakness of current web standards and specifications include a higher knowledge of them creating stricter coding standards.  Thereby, developers will have to acquire new knowledge thereby increasing the price of hiring.  So, smaller businesses cannot afford these developers so create websites does not follow current web standards and specifications, putting them at a disadvantage.  Or, not having a website, putting them at a further disadvantage. </p>

	<p><u>Interoperability, Specific techniques, and Challenges</u></p>	
	<p> “The ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.  Interoperability between devices made by different manufacturers” (Oxford Dictionary).  A feature of our website had to have responsive design, therefore it had to work on mobile devices and different web browsers.  </p>
	<p>...An element of interoperability I used was using % for width thereby allowing videos and images to shrink or growth for different browsers and mobile devices.  (Figure 1)...</p>
	<p>...Another element of interoperability I used was using JQUERY for certain features within my websites that when viewing them of mobile devices look better so that the website was responsive.  Firstly, I used a query for the navigation feature, as the horizontal navigation that would not fit on a straight line on a mobile device, is then vertical like a list.  (Figure 2)  Additionally, I used a query on my timeline, so that all boxes are on the right of the line so that the feature is not reduced in size dramatically if some boxes were kept of the left.  Thus, creative a responsive timeline for mobile users.   (Figure 3)...</p>
	<p>...A further element of interoperability I used was making sure that my website worked in different browsers, I tested this by running the website within each browser (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6)...</p>
	<p>A challenge I faced was with my navigation as the media queries were temperamental and sometimes did not work on certain browsers or mobile devices. Or, increased the width of my webpage inserting a horizontal scroller, hiding a proportion of my webpage.  I had to work around this and figure out how to not have increase. I did this by removing the width of the navigation as it was at 100% which can cause errors, and this seemed to remove the problem.</p>

	<p><u>File Organisation and Mark-up Structuring</u></p>
	<p>File organisation was strict and organised into different folders, depending on content.  The main folder, CMP1130M_THR15615998_Website contained the different website pages (Index.html, product.html, Christmas.html, etc.) alongside the Assets (contained images), CSS (contained stylesheets) and JS (contained JavaScript files) folder.  Naming conventions were logical for clear input into code. I used indentation and spacing mark-up structure to allow ease of use when scrolling throughout my code.  </p>
