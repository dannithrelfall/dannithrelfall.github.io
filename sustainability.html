			<h4><u> Women Empowerment</u></h4>
		<p>Overwhelming evidence indicates achieving equality and empowerment for women entrepreneurs has immediate impacts that benefit them directly as well as society and the economy. As pillars of communities, women invest a sizable portion of the income they earn on the health and education of their children and in their local economies, creating a tremendous economic impact..</p>
		<p>Women around the world have long been critical contributors to Coca-Cola’s business system, and they often face significant barriers to realizing their own economic empowerment. To help women entrepreneurs overcome some of their most common challenges, in 2010 we introduced 5by20, a program designed to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women by 2020. </p>
		<p>In 2016, 5by20 expanded by 41 percent in total, reaching over 513,000 women, and broadening into four new markets: Australia, Guatemala, Italy and Poland. Since 2010, 5by20 has reached more than 1.75 million women across 64 countries.</p>
