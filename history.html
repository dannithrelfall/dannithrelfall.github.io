      <h2>1894</h2>
      <p>Mississippi shop owner Joseph A. Biedenharn began bottling Coca‑Cola after he was impressed by its sales. He sold the drink to his customers in a common glass bottle called a Hutchinson. </p>
	  <p>At the time Biedenharn sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler, who owned the Company. Candler thanked him but took no action. One of his nephews had already urged that Coca‑Cola be bottled, but Candler focused on fountain sales. </p>

      <h2>1916</h2>
      <p>Bottlers worried that a straight-sided bottle wasn’t distinctive enough and that Coca‑Cola was becoming easily confused with ‘copycat’ brands. Glass manufacturers were approached to come up with a unique bottle design for Coca‑Cola. The Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, designed with the famous contour shape, which won enthusiastic approval from Coca‑Cola in 1915 and was introduced in 1916.</p>
